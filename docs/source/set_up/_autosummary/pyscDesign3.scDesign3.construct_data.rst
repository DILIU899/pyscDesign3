pyscDesign3.scDesign3.construct\_data
=====================================

.. currentmodule:: pyscDesign3

.. automethod:: scDesign3.construct_data

.. Note::
    The return value is a `rpy2.rlike.container.OrdDict` . Not all elements in this `dict` like object have to be named but they have a given order. **None** as a key value means an absence of name for the element. For the values without a named key, you can call `byindex` method to get them by index (rank).
