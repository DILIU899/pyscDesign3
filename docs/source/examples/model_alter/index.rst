Model Alteration
================

Introduction
-------------

In this section, we will show how to use scDesign3Py to simulate data and manipulate the model parameters to satisfy your personal demand.

The provided examples are shown as below.

   :maxdepth: 1
   
   Simulate datasets with or without batch effect <with_without_batch>
   Simulate datasets with/without condition effect <with_without_condition>
   Simulate datasets for DE test between discrete cell types <DE_cell>
   Simulate datasets for DE test along continuous trajectory <DE_traj>
   Simulate datasets for SVG test <DE_spatial>
