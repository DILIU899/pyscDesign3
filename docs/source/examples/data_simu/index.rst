Data Simulation
===============

Introduction
-------------

In this section, we will show how to use scDesign3Py to simulate data.

The provided examples are shown as below.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   
   Simulate datasets with cell library size <cell_lib_size>
   Simulate datasets with multiple lineages <mul_lineage>
   Simulate spatial transcriptomic data <spatial>
   Simulate spot-resolution spatial data for cell-type deconvolution <deconvolution>
   Simulate single-cell ATAC-seq data <ATAC>
   Simulate CITE-seq data <CITE>
   Simulate multi-omics data from multiple single-omic datasets <mul_omic>
