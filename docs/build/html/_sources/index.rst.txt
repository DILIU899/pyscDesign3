pyscDesign3: python interface for scDesign3 R package
=====================================================

The R package scDesign3 is a unified probabilistic framework that generates realistic in silico high-dimensional single-cell omics data of various cell states, including discrete cell types, continuous trajectories, and spatial locations by learning from real datasets. 

pyscDesign3 is the python interface of the R package scDesign3, enabling python users to easily use the scDesign3 functions.
